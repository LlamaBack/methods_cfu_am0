# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- feeling pretty good
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- feeling great about it
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- are there ways to check if the right object is passed through as an argument without making an if statement for each argument?
